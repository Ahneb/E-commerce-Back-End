# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description
This is a demonstration of backend api methods. Using postman we can demonstrate the effects of the `get, post, put, and delete` methods for api calls. Using these 4 methods, we set up an empty database that can then be filled as the user desires with 3 different models that are related through the use of `primary keys` and `foreign keys`. This relation shows on the database as you add and update more items. There is also the functionality to search through each of the different models by their specific id number that is `auto-incremented` by the sql db.

To use this app, in the terminal run `npm install` in order to get the needed packages. After packages are installed, login to your mysql account by running the command `mysql -u root -p` to prompt for your password. After inputting your password, you can then copy the path to the `schema.db` file. then type `source (path to the schemafile)` without the parenthesis and hit enter. One that is done, your database will be set up and ready to go. Head back to your regular terminal and then run `nodemon server.js`. With that the server is up and running. Head over to Postman, Insomnia or any other program of your choice where you can make api calls and you are good to go.
